exercises of the course Machine Learning on Cousera

## Introduction ##
This is the matlab code I've written for the exercises of the course Machine Learning on Cousera.
These exercises involves the application of algorithms like linear regression, logistics regression, neural network,
etc. They also showed the whole preocess of applying machine learning models, including training, cross validation, 
regularization, etc.

I've gained a lot from this course. Hope you guys can also enjoy this course and find the beauty behind data!
